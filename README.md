### About me
**I write code that is mostly oriented around game development and graphics. I enjoy reverse engineering and writing mods also.
 I am a passionate programmer, I first learned how to use the scripting language Lua when I was 11, I prefer to work with a team of developers with a clear defined goal as I struggle to think up new projects, so don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like me to help out with a project as I'm always eager to start working on something.
Graphics, especially in the context of games, fascinates me, therefore I've been working to improve my knowledge around it, you will see some projects I've decided to upload here.**
