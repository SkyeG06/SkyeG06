**I'm a young developer, 15 and female. Most of my free time is spent working on projects that mean something to me or learning new concepts that can help in the future.
I'm new to using Github much. I've been an aspiring programmer ever since I was young, 9 years, and ever since that point I started learning how to, it started out as basic Python stuff but now I'm creating things in predominantly C#
It would mean a lot to me if you'd stick around and maybe check out some of the projects I am / have been involved with! <3**
