### About me
**I'm a young developer, 15 and female. Most of my free time is spent working on random project I feel like working on, usually in either C/++ or C#, but I'm proficient in Python and Lua also. A lot of my projects are modding related but I've started to branch out into other areas like graphics programming using OpenGL and C++.
It would mean a lot to me if you'd stick around and maybe check out some of the projects I am / have been involved with! <3**
